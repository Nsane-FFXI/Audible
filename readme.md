# Ashita & Windower Support
Thorny "This is designed in such a way that when complete, it can be loaded on Windower or Ashita and will work on either by using a disambiguation file as the primary addon lua.  Ashita version is not complete yet and has been put off for the time being due to low interest.  This does not indicate a shift to windower on my personal development or a commitment to make any of my other addons compatible with windower.  This project was originally for windower, and I updated it to familiarize myself a bit more with the differences in APIs.  Ashita has been and will remain my priority."
